# Enhanced Legend Discord Role Rules
Because people want to know what exactly you can and can’t do

> Disclaimer: These rules only apply specifically to people trying to get the Enhanced Legend role on the Komaru Cats Projects discord. They are not the specific hard-set rules for the datapack in general.

### The conditions of receiving the role in general are:
Achieve the Enhanced Legend advancement in Enhanced Discoveries Advancement Pack.
As for the versions, at the moment any version above and including 2.5 is suitable. Later the criteria may change.


## YOU CAN:
- Choose your own world seed.
- Use /locate, Amidst, Mineatlas, Chunkbase or other world-viewing tools because we can't really detect them
  > We can determine this by indirect methods, but we cannot be sure by 100%, so it is allowed.
- The only gamerules you can modify are:
  - keepInventory/keep_inventory, which you are allowed to set to true
  - playersSleepingPercentage/players_sleeping_percentage
- Use QOL mods, shaders, gamma, as well as those mods that do not change the gameplay, greatly facilitating the process of obtaining advancements
  - Examples of allowed mods: Sodium, Lithum, Gamma-Utils, Advancement Info, No Fog, Carpet, Xaero's Minimap, Tweakeroo (excluding freecam)
- Use datapacks that follow the rules of allowed mods
- Use TNT, Rail, String, Gravel/Sand/Concrete Powder duping.
- Use /function bacap_rewards or bacaped_rewards:trophy/\<internal tab name>/\<internal advancement name> if you lose your trophy
- If you update to a newer version of the datapack and it causes certain advancements to COMPLETELY reset, you may use commands to give back these advancements.

## YOU CAN'T:
- Use mods that greatly facilitating the process of obtaining advancements
  - Examples of disallowed mods: X-Ray, Meteor Client (and any other cheat clients), Freecam and similar mods, mods that change weather cycle or rare mob loot
- Use Creative or Spectator mode.
- Use item duplication glitches except mentioned in `YOU CAN` section
- Use commands in a way that majorly affects gameplay or disrupts the balance.
  - For example: giving yourself items, teleportation, the /advancement command, etc.
- Give yourself a "second chance" if you are playing Hardcore, because there is a different role - `Hardcore Enhanced Legend`. However, if you do this with the command in vanilla BACAP, you may still get the normal Enhanced Legend.

## GRAY AREAS:
These things do kind of disrupt the balance but may be allowed by Komaru Cats Admin's discretion
- Cooperative mode is allowed only if there are less then 5 people on the server or in one team, if you are using `Team Co-op`

## How to prove you are worthy:

- Send your world file where you completed every advancement to any Komaru Cats Projects admin. You may prune unused chunks in your world to reduce its size prior to uploading it.
- Have some screenshots of your progress, such as building a farm, or a setup to complete a difficult advancement
- It will also be good if you make a video where you show what and how you used to get advancements in your world
- If you are on a server that is publicly joinable (i.e. with no whitelist) you could ask admins if they can join and then you'd show them how you got the more important advancements.

## Other roles rules:
> All methods of proof are arranged in order from the strongest to the weakest. But this does not mean that you are required to have the strongest proofs, as they can still have different value.
> A screenshot proving that the advancement was obtained is mandatory (either at the moment of obtaining it or after, in the advancements menu)
