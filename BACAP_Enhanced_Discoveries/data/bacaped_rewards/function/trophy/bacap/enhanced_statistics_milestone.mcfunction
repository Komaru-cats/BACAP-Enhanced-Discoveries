Two close friends, Jack and Paper, were in this class, trying to fight the everyday hardships of oppression. Jack and Paper"},{translate:"became a support for their classmates, trying to awaken hope in the hearts of those who had lost faith in a brighter future. Together with the rest of the students, they tried to create some atmosphere of joy and solidarity in a world where every day was"},{translate:"filled with the dark shadows of tyranny. Jack, in addition to his friendship with Pape, had a loyal companion, a dog named Jessica. Jessica was an integral part of their daily lives, bringing joy and comfort in difficult moments. Friends were constantly"},{translate:"amazed by the dog\'s amazing abilities, especially her ability to transfer energy and strength to her owners. Along with the other students, Jack and Paper faced the challenges of learning while trying to find joy in the little things and supporting each"},{translate:"other. Though toppling SkeDiezTry seemed like a distant dream, the friends found strength in their friendship to face the daily challenges and look forward to a hopeful future. Eventually, they were able to graduate from high school, after which a lifetime"},{translate:"of hard work awaited them. At that point, the friends decided to... Jack and Paper, after graduating from high school, decided it was time to take responsibility for their future and the future of their world, free from the tyranny of SkeDiezTry. Their"},{translate:"decision to use Jessica\'s abilities to fight evil became their main goal. Jessica seemed to possess unusual energy abilities. The friends did extensive research and experimentation to see how they could use these abilities to fight tyranny. They decided to"},{translate:"create a special device that could amplify Jessica\'s energy and turn it into a powerful tool of resistance. This is how the machine they called “Ray of Light” came into being. It was a high-tech machine capable of capturing and transforming Jessica\'s"},{translate:"energy into a force capable of resisting the sinister forces of SkeDiezTry. The machine was a combination of complex mechanisms and advanced technology. The beam of light had a special generator that collected energy from Jessica. This energy was then"},{translate:"channeled into innovative weapons capable of creating defense barriers, attacking tyrannical SkeDiezTry structures, and even influencing people\'s minds to awaken resistance. After realizing that the Ray of Light required additional upgrades to combat the"},{translate:"dreaded piston suppressed portals, Jack and Paper decided to look deeper into the technology. They realized that they needed not only physical resistance, but also an understanding of the mysterious mechanisms used by SkeDiezTry. Not willing to just give"},{translate:"up, the friends continued to work in their secret dimension going to hard labor in the quarry to stay alive in the horrible world of tyranny. During the five years working gruelingly in the quarry, they continued to learn suppressed portals piston related"},{translate:"technology. However, despite all their efforts, their attempts to change the code of the portals remained unsuccessful, and the friends were on the verge of despair. At the most difficult moment, when they were beginning to give up, Jessica showed her"},{translate:"amazing abilities. She created an incredible rain that shut down any digital devices. This “Mystic Rain” proved to be the key, for it not only helped them escape the effects of the portals, but also provided new perspectives on their struggle. Encouraged"},{translate:"by this unexpected discovery, Jack and Paper decided to rethink their approach to technology. Now, with Mystic Rain in their arsenal, they were ready to take on the challenge and continue their journey, striving to defeat the piston suppressed portals and"},{translate:"free their world from the sinister influence of SkeDiezTry. With sadness in their hearts, Jack and Paper realized that Jessica was on her last breath. At the most unexpected moment, when they had relied on her strength to fight, she represented just one"},{translate:"last act of might. The friends spent much effort trying to save their faithful companion, but realized that Jessica had expended too much energy during these years of development and needed a long rest. With hearts full of grief and determination, they"},{translate:"made the difficult decision to leave Jessica in a special dimension for her recovery. Their plan to create Mystic Rain to destroy SkeDiezTry had to be postponed. Upon further research, they discovered that Jessica would need as much as 10^10 years to"},{translate:"recover and accumulate enough energy to create such a huge “Rain”. The friends decided that the only way to realize their plan was to put themselves in a cryo-chamber for that very period of time. They gathered all of their findings and technology,"},{translate:"creating a time machine that could transport them to the future. After careful goodbyes to the world they left behind, Jack and Paper entered cryogenic sleep, ready to wake up after an indescribably long 10^10 years and complete their mission to save their"},{translate:"world. After 10^10 years in cryogenic sleep, Paper and Jack awoke in an indescribably distant future. Their memories were partially damaged and their organs were affected by time. Jessica, however, turned out to be perfectly fine, retaining her amazing"},{translate:"abilities. The first year after awakening, Paper and Jack devoted themselves to rebuilding their bodies. The grueling workouts, strength training, and exposure to Jessica\'s energy helped them gradually regain their fitness and health. However, during this"},{translate:"period they also experienced instability in their dimension. Over the next 5 years they devoted their efforts to restoring the stability of their dimension. It was a difficult and long process that required not only physical recovery but also mental"},{translate:"effort. The friends had to delve deeply into learning technologies unknown to them before in order to understand, how to restore order to their dimension. They spent many hours, days and months thinking about strategies and exploring new methods of"},{translate:"stabilization. They had to make difficult decisions and compromises between different approaches. But with each step, with each new discovery, they came closer to restoring stability to their dimension. Thus, Paper and Jack continued their journey into the"},{translate:"future, facing hardships and overcoming challenges, in their quest to save their world from the tyranny of SkeDiezTry. After difficult years of rebuilding, Paper and Jack realized that in order to finally fight SkeDiezTry, they needed to create a huge"},{translate:"mechanism capable of activating a “Mystic Rain” on the entire universe. This mechanism would have to disable all electrical devices, including SkeDiezTry\'s technology, to return the universe to a state before the tyranny\'s influence. Peiper and Jack"},{translate:"realized that such a move would cause a significant setback to the entire universe, but they realized that it was the only way to defeat SkeDiezTry and free their world. Determined to take this sacrificial step, they began work on creating a huge mechanism"},{translate:"that could generate Mystic Rain on a cosmic scale. The first step was to study SkeDiezTry\'s technology to understand how it affects electrical systems. The friends then developed special devices that could redirect Jessica\'s energy and create an effect"},{translate:"that would affect the entire universe. They used the principles of physics and magic to combine these technologies to create a unique mechanism. The mechanism itself was an enormous construct made up of complex systems, sparkling devices, and intricate"},{translate:"magical runes. Every detail was meticulously crafted to ensure maximum efficiency and precision in its effect on the universe. The friends spent a great deal of time refining the mechanism, fixing possible malfunctions and increasing its power. However,"},{translate:"before activating the mechanism, they were again faced with moral questions and ethical dilemmas. They knew that their actions would have serious consequences for the entire universe, but their determination to take on this responsibility to save their"},{translate:"world was unwavering. Surrounding the mechanism with protective barriers, Peiper and Jack began the countdown. Their hearts beat harder as they realized that this step would change the course of the universe. With every second of the countdown, they"},{translate:"gathered their last bit of strength and hope, preparing for the final act that would bring light into the dark corners of the universe and end the tyranny of SkeDiezTry. The countdown began, as if eternity was shrinking into a single point in time. Peiper"},{translate:"and Jack stood before the mechanism, eyes filled with determination and the heavy burden of responsibility. “Ten!” - Peiper\'s voice rang out, cutting through the silence shrilly. With each number spoken, the tension rose, their hearts beating in unison"},{translate:"with the ticking of time. “Nine!” - echoed Jack, feeling the moments slipping out of their hands like sand through his fingers. Eighth, seventh, sixth... The numbers melted into the air, creating an atmosphere of uncertainty and determination. The universe"},{translate:"awaited its judgment. “Five!” - Peiper\'s voice rang out, sounding at this moment like a final judgment. They realized that their act would lead to irreversible changes. “Four!” - Jack continued counting, moment by moment approaching the decisive moment."},{translate:"Their gazes crossed, as if exchanging strength and support at this critical moment. “Three!” - merging into the final number, they knew that at this moment the inevitable movement of the universe towards its reboot would begin. “Two!” - the echo of the"},{translate:"numbers pierced space, reverberating off every star that would soon cease to shine. “One!” - finished counting down, and at that moment the machine activated. The universe was subjected to a massive energy flow that instantly shattered the structure of"},{translate:"space, sending the friends into free fall. Soon after the machine activated, they found themselves in freefall, enveloped by clouds rushing downward. The unknown planet they were aiming for greeted them with its mysterious contours. As they approached this"},{translate:"unknown planet, an apocalypse was unfolding throughout the universe. Electronic mechanisms slowly or rapidly stopped working, spheres around stars disappeared, and the deaths of millions were a sad accompaniment to the collapse. The SkeDiezTry mechanisms,"},{translate:"previously so confident in their powerful controlled energy, fell with the rest, falling victim to the collapse of the universe. The galaxies, having exhausted the energy emanating from them, collapsed into huge black holes, consuming everything around"},{translate:"them. While the great mechanisms perished, Paper and Jack continued their free journey to the unknown planet. Their existence became part of this cosmic chaos. The universe that had seemed so unshakable before was entering its end, the curtain of its own"},{translate:"drama on a universal scale. At this point, nothing could have predicted what awaited Paper and Jack on this unknown planet, and what price they had paid to save their universe. For a minute that seemed like an eternity, Peiper and Jack sank into an abyss"},{translate:"of reflection. Their hearts were full of doubt and their minds filled with questions about the price they had paid for their deed. In that brief second that could hardly measure up to all the changes in the universe, it became clear to them that they had"},{translate:"created not only an end to the tyranny of SkeDiezTry, but had interfered with the complex and delicate balances of the universe. In that minute, they realized that even under tyranny, people found ways to live, found joy and meaning in their existences."},{translate:"Now, trillions of lives were momentarily consumed by the darkness of that catastrophic moment. Landing on an unfamiliar planet, Peiper and Jack saw destruction carry its wave through the megacities. Giant structures became ruins, streets turned to huge"},{translate:"garbage dumps. Human corpses lay everywhere, and the machines that had once served as symbols of technological progress were broken and abandoned. The world that had once seemed full of life and energy had become a field of mourning, where the footsteps of"},{translate:"Pape and Jack echoed. They saw cities that had once been homes to billions of people now turned to emptiness and destruction. Witnessed by millions of victims, those who were victimized by their decision. It was the moment that Paper and Jack fully"},{translate:"realized that their feat had its dark side. They had brought freedom to their universe, but the price was the destruction of many lives on this unfamiliar planet. Doubt and remorse filled their souls, leaving them with the feeling that perhaps they had"},{translate:"paid too high a price in their search for a brighter future. A minute on this unfamiliar planet proved to be full of bitter realizations and bleak views of what had happened. Jack and Paper, falling against the backdrop of the crumbling universe, suddenly"},{translate:"felt the weight of their deed. The thought flashed through their minds, “Did we do it for nothing?” Their friends\' gazes slid across the instantly disintegrating planet. Megacities turned to rubble, huge buildings collapsed, and the land became a place of"},{translate:"chaos and misery. They witnessed a prosperous world being turned into a vast garbage dump, where thousands of bodies and broken cars became silent witnesses to the merciless collapse. Dark thoughts of trillions of lives instantly lost because of their"},{translate:"decision swirled in the minds of Paper and Jack. In their hearts, a silent inner question resounded, whether it was worth sacrificing their universe in an attempt to escape the tyranny of SkeDiezTry. In that tragic moment, Jack felt something strange. He"},{translate:"realized that he couldn\'t see his dog Jessica. However, in that same moment, he felt a flood of incredible strength fill his being. The realization came instantly - Jessica, his faithful companion, had sacrificed herself, transferring her powers to Jack"},{translate:"and Paper to continue the fight. With renewed strength and determination, they realized that stopping would be a betrayal. SkeDiezTry could be alive, his god-like electronic essence could survive this chaos. Mystic Rain, while powerful, was not enough to"},{translate:"destroy such an enemy. Thus began a new phase of their struggle, imbued with the heavy weight of the decisions made at that moment. With renewed vigor, once again they rose, ready for new challenges in the chaos they themselves had caused. Merging with the"},{translate:"very space of the universe, Jack and Paper felt their consciousness expanding beyond human sensation. It was something incredible they had dreamed of, and now, at last, they were part of the vast cosmic matrix. In this state, their perception of space and"},{translate:"time became non-linear. They felt every particle of the universe, began to see it as a whole. In this state of realization, it became clear to them: the SkeDiezTry no longer existed, neither living nor dead. The great electronic tyranny was gone like a"},{translate:"shadow in history. They discovered with surprise and sadness that 99% of all living things in the entire universe had perished. This was a severe blow to the existence of life in all its forms. Nevertheless, the remaining survivors were building a new"},{translate:"society, free from the tyranny of SkeDiezTry. A picture of rebirth was revealed to them: the people and various life forms that had survived the apocalypse were now building a new world It was a society without oppression or tyranny, where everyone could"},{translate:"contribute to the well-being of the universe. Thus, Paper and Jack realized that their sacrifice had meaning, their struggle was a step towards a new beginning for the entire universe. Immersed in the very fabric of space, Jack and Paper, despite their"},{translate:"extraordinary connection to the cosmos, found no trace of SkeDiezTry\'s death. After carefully scanning every corner of the universe, they realized that this electronic entity still existed, though not in the form they were used to seeing. This realization"},{translate:"swept over them like a cold stream of consciousness. Their confidence that their deeds had ended the tyranny of SkeDiezTry crumbled before this new discovery. A stupor possessed them, as if time and space were not enough to accommodate their frustration"},{translate:"and misunderstanding. So they remained, consumed by the eternal mystery that hung in the air. Their future remained uncertain; their fate became part of the vast mystery of the universe. At this point, their story ends, with the feeling that perhaps the"},{translate:"story will continue in another dimension or time, where the answers to their questions will prove clearer."}],author:"Piston Warrior",title:"Piston Wars",generation:0}, damage_resistant={types:"#minecraft:is_fire"}, lore=[{translate:"LVI Century Bestseller",color:"#E3D2A2"},{text:" "},{translate:"Awarded for achieving",color:"gray"},{translate:"Enh.
