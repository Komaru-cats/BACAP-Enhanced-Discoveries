## How to Install?

**The downloaded datapack should be a zipped file named "BACAP Enhanced Discoveries" and then followed by its version number.**

### Installation instructions are as follows:

For a new world: You can click the "Data Packs" option when creating a new world. Upon doing this, either open the world folder and copy in the zipped file, or click and drag the zipped file directly into the menu. Once it is imported, mouse over the icon for Enhanced Discoveries advancements pack so an arrow appears, then click the arrow to load the datapack.

For an existing world: Click on the world in the singleplayer menu, then click "Edit", then "Open World Folder". Then go into the "datapacks" folder, and copy and paste the zipped file from the download here.

Once the datapack is installed, go into the world. A message should pop up saying you are using BlazeandCave's advancements pack. If not, check your advancements menu. You should see the custom tab named "BlazeandCave's Advancements."
