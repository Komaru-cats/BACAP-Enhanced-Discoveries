## How to Install?

### TODO

## Updating to newer versions

- Make a backup of your world for safety if you screw anything up
- Leave your world for more safety and don't go in during the process
- Delete the old datapacks COMPLETELY from your world
- Copy and paste in the new updated datapacks
- - **Dont rename them**
- Go into your world
- If you screwed up, go to your backup, make a backup of your backup, then repeat steps 2-6 on the backup.
